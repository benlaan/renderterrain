= Introduction =

This project contains two implementions of Level Of Detail (LOD) terrain rendering. These were inspired by the following publications:

 * Discrete Level Of Detail Algorithm, as found on www.gamasutra.com, by Chris Dallaire, entitled "Binary Triangle Trees for Terrain Tile Index Buffer Generation".
 * Terrain Simplification Simplified: A General Framework for View-Dependant Out-of-Core Visualization, by Peter Lindstrom. This was referenced by Shamus Young, who wrote an OpenGL implementation.

I am currently using Simplification algorithm, as I understand it. It is probably not a good implementation of it, but is sufficient at this stage for my needs.

It currently supports _very_ limited shading.. by combining 4 textures based on height. No texture maps per 'real world' terrain data.

= To Do List =
 * Better shader effects
 * improved camera logic
 * text for logging, fps, etc
 * text-based command menu
